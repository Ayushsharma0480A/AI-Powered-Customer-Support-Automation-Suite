Hi team,
I am extremely unhappy that my issue is still not solved after 5 days.
Please fix it urgently.

The product works really well!
Thank you for your amazing support.

I’m confused about how to configure automations.
Can you please guide me?

This is very frustrating. I asked twice for a refund but got no response.

Thanks a lot for the quick help — everything is working perfectly now.

Our CSAT scores are not showing. Not sure if it is a bug or something we misconfigured.

Things worked yesterday but today nothing is syncing. Quite annoying.

Perfect! The setup works smoothly now.
Appreciate it.

We still can’t login even after resetting our password.
Please resolve this.

Thank you for your support, but the emails are still not syncing properly.
